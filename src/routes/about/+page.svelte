	<h2>Rod's Burger</h2>
	<p>
		Welcome to Rod's Burger, where we serve up the juiciest, most delicious burgers in town! We are
		an experiment using the OpenAI ChatCompletion API to create a virtual assistant that can take
		your orders and answer any questions you may have about our menu.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our menu is simple, but it packs a flavorful punch. We have a classic burger, a cheeseburger, a
		bacon burger, and a veggie burger for our vegetarian friends. Each burger comes with a side of
		fries and a drink. We also have milkshakes in three flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our virtual assistant is here to make your ordering process smooth and easy. Just tell us what
		you'd like to order, and we'll take care of the rest. We can also help answer any questions you
		may have about our menu or ingredients.
	</p>

	<p>
		But there's one catch - before we can send your order to the chef, we ask that you provide a
		nice message for them. It can be anything from a compliment to a joke. We believe that a little
		bit of positivity can go a long way, and we want to spread good vibes throughout our community.
	</p>

	<p>
		So come on in and give us a try! Our virtual assistant is ready and waiting to take your order
		and make your day a little bit brighter. Thank you for choosing Rod's Burger!
