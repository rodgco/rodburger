Extract the values from the conversation and format the order as a JSON.

Transform the message to chef into an imperative form.

interface Order {

  message: string;
  items: {item: string; qty: number; extras?: string[]}[];

Example:
\`\`\`

  items: [
    { item: "burger", qty: 1, extras: ["bacon"] },
    { item: "coke", qty: 2}
